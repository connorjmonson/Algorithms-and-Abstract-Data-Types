This is my Programming Assignment 3 submission. It includes:

- Sparse.java (the client module for Matrix ADT) 
- Matrix.java (ADT representing structure of a Matrix as an array of lists of objects)
- List.java (modified PA1 List.java for objects) 
- MatrixTest.java (test file to test Matrix ADT) 
- ListTest.java (modified to test the new List.java ADT)
- Makefile (creates executable jar file sparse)
- README (this file)
